=== A lot of this stuff has changed I'll have to update it ===

Things seem to fall into 3 general categories:

1. Equipment - Things like servers, switches, racks, routers, etc.

2. Parts - Things like NICS, ports, U (rack space), etc.

3. Resources - IP ranges/network blocks, space (U, datacenter space), etc.

These are loose categories 


Kinds of matching:

1. the given key value pairs exist in Thing
2. for the given keys the values match exactly in the Thing
3. the given key/values exactly match attributes of Thing


Questions I'd like to be able to answer questions like:

* get 4 servers in datacenter Z with status == unallocated 
  each in a different rack

servers = []
d = clusto.getByName('datacenterZ')
racks = d.getConnectedMatching(AttributeDict(Racks.allMetaAttrs()))
for r in racks:
    s = r.getConnectedMatching(Servers.allMetaAttrs() + [('status', 'unallocated')])
    servers.append(s.pop())


* get console for server X
* add service W on server X to loadbalancer vip Y

clusto expressions (maybe)
-----------------------

driver:Console connected to name:server2
 - return the console connected to 'server2'

driver:Server
 - return all serves

driver:Server connected to name:rack002
 - return servers in rack002

attr:foo,12 and driver:Server
 - return servers with attr foo,12

pattern
-------
alphanumeric
* glob supported ? 
* regex supported ?

pattern types
----------
name:<somename> 
driver:<driver>
attr:<key,val>

operators
---------
not, or, and,

clusto categorization ideas
===========================

Class, Role, Service

Class is similar to the class concept from fai.  The classes of a server, for
example, might include information about what software is installed on that
machine or how much ram the machine has or how many disks.

Role is a description of the job of a Thing.  So a server could have the roles
of Production, LiveWebserver, and Mail.  These roles are generally more
abstract and don't refer to specific software or hardware properties
themselves.  The can however require that the server be a member of certain
Classes.  So the Blog role might require that the server be connected to the
Webserver class while the LiveSite role would require the server be connected
to the Apache and BigMem classes.

A Service is an instance of a role. So you can have dbslave14... (not sure of
the value of this)

A Pool is just a grouping of Things.  For example you could have many Servers
with a 'dbslave' role but with some in a 'production' pool and others in a
'development' pool.  

(how do you put two db roles on one machine?)
  ( up to sysadmins.  might use VMs, might use vservers (like openvz), might
    put things on separate ports)


clusto command line ideas
=========================

clusto connect foo1 foo2
 - connect foo1 and foo2

clusto power off server1
 
clusto locate server1
 - should return:
 server1 -> connected to port 4 on switch2a
 server1 -> connected to RU13 in rack101
 
clusto console server1
 - connect to console on server1

clusto attr del <key> [<value>]
clusto attr add <key> <value> [<value>] [<value>] ...
clusto attr get <key>
clusto attr set <key> <value> [<value>] [<value>] ...
 - modify Thing attributes

clusto network setvlan server1 eth1 vlan203
  - put eth1 on server1 onto vlan203

clusto rebuild server1
 - reinstall operating system onto server1
