Things seem to fall into 3 general categories:

1. Equipment - Things like servers, switches, racks, routers, etc.

2. Parts - Things like NICS, ports, U (rack space), etc.

3. Resources - IP ranges/network blocks, space (U, datacenter space), etc.

These are loose categories 


Kinds of matching:

1. the given key value pairs exist in Thing
2. for the given keys the values match exactly in the Thing
3. the given key/values exactly match attributes of Thing
