Things seem to fall into 3 general categories:

1. Equipment - Things like servers, switches, racks, routers, etc.

2. Parts - Things like NICS, ports, U (rack space), etc.

3. Resources - IP ranges/network blocks, space (U, datacenter space), etc.

These are loose categories 


Kinds of matching:

1. the given key value pairs exist in Thing
2. for the given keys the values match exactly in the Thing
3. the given key/values exactly match attributes of Thing


Questions I'd like to be able to answer questions like:

* get 4 servers in datacenter Z with status == unallocated 
  each in a different rack

servers = []
d = clusto.getByName('datacenterZ')
racks = d.getConnectedMatching(AttributeDict(Racks.allMetaAttrs()))
for r in racks:
    s = r.getConnectedMatching(Servers.allMetaAttrs() + [('status', 'unallocated')])
    servers.append(s.pop())


* get console for server X
* add service W on server X to loadbalancer vip Y

clusto expressions (maybe)
-----------------------

driver:Console connected to name:server2
 - return the console connected to 'server2'

driver:Server
 - return all serves

driver:Server connected to name:rack002
 - return servers in rack002

attr:foo,12 and driver:Server
 - return servers with attr foo,12

pattern
-------
alphanumeric
* glob supported ? 
* regex supported ?

pattern types
----------
name:<somename> 
driver:<driver>
attr:<key,val>

operators
---------
not, or, and, 

functions
---------
