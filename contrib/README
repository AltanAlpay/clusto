discovery.py -- Module for discovering information about hosts, not directly
				callable
etchosts.py -- Attempt to discover and create clusto server objects based on
			   the content of a hosts file. May need modification in main() to
			   achieve the desired effect.
parsearp.py -- Imported by etchosts.py, allows discovery and creation of objects
			   based on the output of scapy's arpping command
sysinfo.py -- Uses paramiko to connect to servers and gather information about
			  disks, processors, and memory to store in clusto attributes
watcher.py -- If run with the "snmp" option, it watches for SNMP traps and
			  creates new clusto objects bound to the correct rack and switch
			  port. If run with the "dhcp" option, it will watch for DHCP
			  requests containing vendor IDs matching PXE clients and IPMI
			  cards. Associates the MAC address with the proper interface on
			  the server object.
